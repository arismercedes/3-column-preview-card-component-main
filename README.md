## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

So for this project my goal was to understand flexbox, so I used the most flexbox properties I could in this project. 

### Continued development

My next goal is to understand CSS Grid and keep learning best practices for HTML and CSS

### Useful resources

- [Learn Flexbox in 15 mins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYq5PXgSsbE&t=12s&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified) - This helped me understand flexbox.
- [CSS Flexbox Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXIhdp5R7sc&t=328s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) - Same as the other resource but with more detailed examples.
